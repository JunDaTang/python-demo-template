## Description

This rule ensures that after Cursor IDE automatically performs changes from Git commits, the modified files are automatically committed back to Git using the conventional commit format. This maintains a clear and consistent commit history that explains what changes were made and why.

## Rule

After Cursor IDE performs automatic changes:

1. All modified files MUST be automatically committed
2. Commit messages MUST follow the conventional commit format
3. Commit messages MUST include:
   1. Type: The type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
   2. Scope: The affected component or area (optional)
   3. Description: A clear explanation of what changed
   4. Body: Detailed explanation of why the changes were made
4. The commit message MUST reference the original prompts used to generate the changes

## Implementation

- The Cursor IDE will:
  - Track all files modified by automatic changes
  - Generate a conventional commit message based on the changes
  - Include the original prompts in the commit body
  - Automatically execute the git commit command
  - Handle any potential merge conflicts or errors

## Benefits

- Maintains clear and consistent commit history
- Provides traceability between prompts and code changes
- Follows industry-standard commit conventions
- Automates the commit process for better workflow efficiency

## Examples
